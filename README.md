# Hospital Queue Simulation
#Author: Farha Fuard

#Purpose:
To model and analyze hospital queue performance under different load conditions using discrete-event simulation.

#Requirements:
Install the following Python libraries before running the code:
         pip install simpy matplotlib

#How to Run:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code or any Python IDE.

2. Make sure the script file is named hospital_queue.py.

3. Run the simulation: python hospital_queue.py

4. The simulation will automatically create a folder named results/ containing:
        Patient wait time histograms for each scenario
        Comparative bar charts for average wait time and throughput
        A text output of scenario results in the console

#Scenarios Simulated:

1. Low Load

2. Medium Load

3. High Load

4. Fast Treatment

Output Location:
All generated plots and metrics are saved in the /results folder within the project directory
